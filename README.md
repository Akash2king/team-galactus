# Marine Navigation System - Hybrid Algorithm

## Overview

This project presents a hybrid shortest path algorithm specifically designed for marine navigation systems. The proposed algorithm combines heuristic concepts and a bidirectional approach with traditional shortest path algorithms to improve computational efficiency and optimize memory usage. The hybrid approach integrates three specific algorithms, enhancing overall performance, particularly in long-distance scenarios.

## Proposed Solution

### Idea

The hybrid shortest path algorithm is designed to optimize marine navigation by incorporating the following components:

- **Hierarchical Structure:** A hierarchical approach is used to reduce the search space, similar to how navigators focus on major marine routes while avoiding unsafe paths like storms and typhoons.
- **Bidirectional Search:** This approach significantly reduces computation time by searching from both the origin and the destination simultaneously.
- **Heuristics:** Heuristic concepts are integrated to guide the search more intelligently, improving speed and efficiency.

### Implementation Results

The implementation of this hybrid algorithm demonstrates significant speed-ups, especially in long-distance scenarios, while maintaining accuracy comparable to traditional algorithms like Dijkstra and A*. This makes the algorithm highly suitable for real-time marine navigation.

### Prototype

The project includes a prototype that visualizes the proposed solution, enhancing the efficiency of marine navigation systems by leveraging a combination of hierarchical structuring and a bidirectional approach. The prototype's visualization is available as a web page.
